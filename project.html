          <p style="font-size: large;">ABSTRACT: &nbsp;
              Predicting the movement of the stock market is challenging but crucial work, as it can lead to substantial financial gains through astute investing. In the face of non-stationary, chaotic data, it is difficult for investors to make profitable stock market investments. Unlike rule-based programming, machine learning (ML) enables systems to learn without being 
explicitly programmed by interacting with the natural world and generalizing from examples. Utilizing these skills, one speculates on future stock market movements. Using data on daily opening price closing price, lowest price, highest price, and volume, the machine learning algorithm of this paper can predict the future stock price and shuffle using subsist algorithms and open source libraries, thereby making this unpredictable business format somewhat more predictable. This study predicts stock market values using machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees Support Vector Regression (Linear and RBF kernels), Linear Regression, and Random Forest. This study uses the firm's stock price and volume over time. We examined for anomalies and normalized the data's characteristics during preprocessing. The training and assessment sets of the dataset were then split 70:30. The accuracy tests revealed that every algorithm performed within a 95% confidence interval. Important to investors, this study demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict stock market prices accurately. It has been demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can predict stock market trends accurately. The ability of machine learning to analyze immense datasets, learn from experience, and adapt to fluctuating market conditions makes ML-based stock prediction intriguing and valuable for investors.</p>
